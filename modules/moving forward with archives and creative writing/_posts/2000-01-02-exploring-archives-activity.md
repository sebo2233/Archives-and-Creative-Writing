# Moving Ahead    
Sketch out a plan for how you might like to proceed with this project. Consider the following:
- How much time and energy, and how many resources, can I put towards this work?
- What questions am I most interested in addressing through my writing? 
- What types of resources (e.g. written materials, visuals, conversations) might be able to help me think through those questions?
- What feels like a good way to record your findings and respond with your writing?

Keep a journal of your thoughts and responses as you go through this research process. The entries can be diaristic, free writes, or more structured writing. Whatever feels best to you! Here are some prompts to think about in your process:
- What types/formats of materials are you finding in your process? Does the type of material affect your response to the content?
- What places, people, moments, language, or visuals stand out to you? Why?
- What further questions do you have?
