# Digital Collections Search
1. Choose an item from Barnard's [digital collections](https://digitalcollections.barnard.edu/) or NYPL's [digital collections](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/)
2. Write for five to ten minutes, considering the following questions from ["Using Archives and Special Collectiond in Creative Writing Research"](https://blog.yorksj.ac.uk/infoincurriculum/2019/06/05/using-archives-and-special-collections-in-creative-writing-research/) by Katherine Hughes and Clare McClulskey-Dean:
   - How might you use this resource for Creative Writing research?
   - What can you learn about the historical and local context in which the resource was created?
   - Who was the author/creator of the resource and what can you learn about them?
   - Why do you think this particular resource was preserved by its creator and/or by the archive?
   - What gaps or absences can you detect?
3. Find the finding aid for the collection of which your item is a part. Skim through it, paying close attention to historical, biographical, and scope and content notes.
   - For item’s from Barnard’s digital collections, the image will have the collection name under the “details” heading. You can search for that collection on Barnard’s [Collections website](https://collections.barnard.edu/public/).  At NYPL, the items on their digital collections will have collection information linked under the “item data” heading. You can also cross-reference with their Archives & Manuscripts [finding aid website](https://archives.nypl.org/) and/or go to the digital collections site, click “browse,” and then click “collections.” Then select a collection of interest and click “about.”
4. After taking a look at the finding aid, see if you have anything to add to the questions above.

# Working with Prompts
Choose another item (or continue working with the same item) and spend some time working with one or more of the following prompts:
- Erasure
    - First, read ["The Near Transitive Properties of the Political and Poetical: Erasure"](https://thevolta.org/ewc28-ssharif-p1.html) by Solmaz Sharif
    - Optional: ["The Weight of What's Left {out}: Six Contemporary Ereasurists on Their Craft"](https://kenyonreview.org/2012/11/erasure-collaborative-interview/) by Andrew David King
- [Found poetry](https://poets.org/glossary/found-poem)
    - If working with archives of a writer, consider a [cento](https://poets.org/glossary/cento)
- Consider using anaphora or writing a sestina using language from your source
- Imagine the life of the creator and/or the subject
- Writing about your point of view: what does the object look like, what do you observe, what does it make you think about?
- Imagining the object’s point of view: what does it feel, what does it see, what does it think about or remember?
